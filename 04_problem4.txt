The ##### wandered through the fields,
its sturdy legs carrying it over rocky #####.
Unlike the horses grazing nearby, the #####

laughing as they tried to catch up. Despite their excitement,
the ##### remained calm, flicking its ears in response to the noise.
As the sun began to set, the ##### made its way back to the barn, ready for a quiet evening.
